      "First, I notice that the text has a section labeled \"Embedded AI - JN-062025-6770844 | Michael Page\". This seems like a job title along with a reference number. The job is in Bangalore, and it's a temporary position with a salary range of INR100,000 - INR101,000 per year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking further, under \"Your Responsibilities,\" there are several bullet points. These outline the tasks the role entails, such as developing embedded machine learning models, ensuring performance and efficiency, integrating ML algorithms, and collaborating with engineers. I'll need to include these as the job description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, under \"Our Requirements,\" there are details about the qualifications needed. This includes a degree in Computer Science or related fields, proficiency in certain programming languages, experience with specific ML frameworks, understanding of embedded systems, and a minimum of 2 years of experience. These points will form the skills section.\n",

      "The experience required is clearly stated as 2+ years, so that's straightforward. The role is for an Embedded AI position, so that will be the role key.\n",

      "I also notice that there are similar jobs listed at the end, but the main job posting seems to be the one detailed at the top. I'll focus on extracting that one for now. If there were multiple job postings, I would create an array of JSON objects, but in this case, it looks like there's only one.\n",
